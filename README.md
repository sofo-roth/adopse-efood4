# adopse-efood4

A project for a university subject. Our goal is to create an e-food application. The user will be able to find food stores near him and order food. Registered users will be able to view the history of their orders and more. For more information check the wiki.

**Steps to open and use the app:**

   **1.Open a local Apache & MySql server with XAMPP**
   
   **2.Create database efoodusers (utf8_bin)**
                              
   **3.Execute e-egafes.sql**
                              
   **4.Execute efooddata.sql**
                              
   **5.Open solution**
   
   **6.Make sure you have e-fages_project4 as startup project**
                              
   **7.Login with admin/admin credentials or create new user**
